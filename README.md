# LED bubble display

This project is an ESP8266-based multiplexed driver for an 14 digit LED bubble display I have found somewhere.
It uses a separate battery charging and protection circuit, but has an internal LDO, more than capable enough to supply the display and the micro with sufficient power.

## Roadmap

[x] Redesign with looser tolerances
[ ] Design and print case
[ ] Solder board
[ ] Finish MicroPython firmware, or develop native
